This repository consists of two jupyter notebooks which can be opened in Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook.
Data can be downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/c/santander-customer-transaction-prediction/data

I've explored the effectivity of few models on this data, two of which can be found in this repository.
In notebook lgb_santander.ipynb my Light Gradient Boosting model can be found and in ffn_santander.ipynb I've used a simple Self Normalizing Neural Network.

From all models that were tested by me, LGB has shown the best performance, which got me into top 33% in this competition:
